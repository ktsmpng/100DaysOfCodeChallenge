100DaysOfCodeChallenge - Day 11

I am currently using an interactive site https://learngitbranching.js.org/ to learn Git.
Today I did more challenges on the site to do with rebase and advanced git practice - using modifiers to navigate to different parents of the current checkout commit and chaining the ~ ^ commands in git. I completed all the challenges on the main topics of git and now moving on to working with remote git repositories.
