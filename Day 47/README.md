100DayOfCodeChallenge - Day 47

1) Continuing to DrumPad

Issue:
OnPress still not working only works with click.
- Found out that onKeyPress does not send value so it was not able to access source from library.
- Alternative suggestion was to access value from .keyCode, however i was not successful.
