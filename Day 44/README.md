100DayOfCodeChallenge - Day 44

1) Temporarily removed the component and trying to test functions within App Component
2) Added eventlisteners to try resolve issue - componenetWillMount and componenWillUnmount

Bugs:

Issue with OnKeyPress function as only works when clicked and then it is locked to that sound until another pad is clicked.
