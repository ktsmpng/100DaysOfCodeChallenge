100DaysOfCodeChallenge - Day 54

1) Polyglot Dev Application - Reconfigured database by creating db with polyglot user, exporting database url, and making migrations.

Issues:

Had old project which has master behind with new commits. Was unable to rebase so cloned new master project but latest working updates are on develop branch.
