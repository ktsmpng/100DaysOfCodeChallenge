100DaysOfCodeChallenge - Day 8

Today I decided to take a break from JavaScript and continue my work with Git.

I am currently using an interactive site https://learngitbranching.js.org/ to learn Git and my challenge for today is to find a solution for commiting to master from a different branch which has a bugFix without the debug statements(these are in a different branch).

This task is mainly to test my knowledge on using "rebase and cherry-picking commits".
