100DaysOfCodeChallenge - Day 78

1) Splitting Todo App into presentational components and containers

Benefits:

Makes components reusuable as they are stateless.
Any data that is change is being handled in the container - 

example usecase : If a clock has class container which handles logic the presentational component can be switched for example from analog to digital.
