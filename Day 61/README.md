100DaysOfCodeChallenge - Day 61

1) Worked on getting input from input fields and sending of form to API
2) Seperated out component into TODO form
3) Issue with CORS was fixed. Might have been to do with changing branches on git and cached code.

Issues:

Form must take two inputs to send.
	* Possible solution- disable submit button if both fields are required until they have been inputed in box
	* show error message to notify user
