100DaysOfCodeChallenge - Day 19

1) Continuing on Javascript track on FCC. Still working on cash register algorithm.
Can't figure out how to get the change needed and push the array. 

Retrospective
- I tried today to reverse loop through the cid array and deduct from change due. This would take the largest unit of change and deduct from the change due. A conditional would be in place to make sure that the unit of change doesnt equal zero and if the change due left is less than the last unit of change it will deduct from the change due and return that. 

Task for tomorrow
- I need to figure out if it is returning the correct change 
- Then add conditionals to the if conditional that if it doesnt return -1 to change the values in the return object.
