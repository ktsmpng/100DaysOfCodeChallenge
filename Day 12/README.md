100DaysOfCodeChallenge - Day 11

I am currently using an interactive site https://learngitbranching.js.org/ to learn Git.
Today I did more challenges I finished challenges on the Git Remote Track. Mainly it was learning how to sync code between the repositories using pull fetch and rebase. For example if I were to clone a repository local, build a new feature and there are changes made remotely how would I push the code then given that the code has been made redundendent since the version of the code remote is more advanced in the remote branch.
