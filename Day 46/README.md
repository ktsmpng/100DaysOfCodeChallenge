100DayOfCodeChallenge - Day 46

1) Continuing to build simple clock that uses ComponentDidMount/ ComponentDidUnmount.

Issue:
Unsuccessful attempt because state would not change and update the new time or would only update once.
Perhaps it is something to do with setting a variable - const of the current this state. So there is something to be compared with when it changes as it worked after once i followed the tutorial perfectly but this will have to be looked at.
