Git Branching

Exercise 1:

The "git cherry-pick" command allows us to copy a series of commits below the current HEAD element.

Exercise 2:

When we don't know what commits to commit we can alternatively use the interactive rebase 
option which allows us to review a series of commits you are about to rebase.

We can access this function via the "rebase -i" command. Git will open up a UI, show hashes and its corresponding messages.

It will also allow for reordering commits by dragging and dropping in their order.

You can omit commits.
