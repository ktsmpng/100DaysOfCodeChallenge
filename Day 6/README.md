100DaysOfCodeChallenge - Day 6

Today I continued my progress on the FreeCodeCamp JavaScript track. Whilst I was unable to finish my last algorithm I figured I would move on to the next challenge and come back to it later. I reckon that would give me a fresh perspective of the problem rather than being pigeon holed into thinking one way. In this challenge I learnt about Conditional Operators which is a handy way of writing if, else statements in javascript. This is not the most elegant solution but I was able to complete the challenge using them.

- Intermediate Algorithm Scripting: Arguments Optional

Task: 

Create a function that sums two arguments together. If only one argument is provided, then return a function that expects one argument and returns the sum.

For example, addTogether(2, 3) should return 5, and addTogether(2) should return a function.

Calling this returned function with a single argument will then return the sum:

var sumTwoAnd = addTogether(2);

sumTwoAnd(3) returns 5.

If either argument isn't a valid number, return undefined.
